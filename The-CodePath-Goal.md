We are a startup called [CodePath](http://codepath.com) founded by [Nathan Esquenazi](https://github.com/nesquena) and [Tim Lee](https://twitter.com/timothy1ee). We are a very small company with a vision of changing the way developers learn and play with new technologies and platforms.

As software engineers, we all have a strong need to "keep up" with the rapidly changing field of software development. Have you ever wanted to play with a new technology and wished that you had **other engineers to learn and collaborate with**, **mentors to save you countless hours** and guide your learning as well as **high-quality curriculum and projects** to make learning more efficient and fun?

**Yeah, we did too**. This is in large part why we founded [CodePath](http://codepath.com). We are engineers and founders and we wanted a better way for engineers to learn exciting new languages and platforms. We learned mobile on our own (by ourselves) using books and blog posts and we want to take the time to make it easier for everyone else.

## Open-Source Documentation

When we started learning Android and iOS, we were frustrated with the "outdated", vague and deprecated guides we saw littered around the internet. Why was open-source software changing the world but if I wanted to learn about how to use fragments for Android, finding up-to-date and **practical** documentation was like pulling teeth. Often only **stack overflow** and a random blog post would be available to help me learn. And often the posts had outdated or misleading information.

We think as open-source developers and as software engineers, we can do better. Why not have a crowdsourced Android (or any platform for that matter) documentation repository that **any developer can edit**? Why can't we work together to **save others countless hours of pain and frustration** resulting from old blog posts and outdated tutorials? Please help us get the word out to as many Android developers as possible!

## Meet Engineers and Mentors

In addition, as engineers we always wish we could meet other engineers to hack with, and maybe even mentors to learn the new technologies from. Imagine how many hundreds of hours you could save if you had an experienced engineer in the trenches guiding your learning and reviewing your code. Not to mention people to hack on cool projects with. 

Still, we would want it all to be **free and accessible to any serious engineers** looking to learn new tech. Most engineers have full-time jobs. This is why we started the [free "evening" bootcamps](http://codepath.com/androidbootcamp) in San Francisco. Where we run engineers in cohorts through everything they need to know to do Android or iOS development. If you are in San Francisco and want to learn Android, be sure to check out our [free meetup events](http://www.meetup.com/Learning-Android-Development/) as well! We want to help connect smart engineers together so they can build cool things. 

## How do I help?

Right now, we are [building curriculum](http://guides.codepath.com), [creating in-person and online bootcamps](http://codepath.com/androidbootcamp) and [running meetup events](http://www.meetup.com/Learning-Android-Development/) to change the way people learn Android (and hack with other engineers).

At the moment, the best way to help is to **contribute to our guides** or tell as many developers about them as possible. If you see a missing topic, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/issues) or add the wiki page yourself. A [list of missing cliffnotes](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/issues/2) might be a good place to start. If you see inaccurate information, [let us know](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/issues) or fix it directly! 

Another way to help out is to [answer questions on our Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/codepath-android-guides) where new users can ask questions and people can discuss topics related to Android and these guides.

If you want to learn Android, [join our free bootcamps](http://codepath.com/androidbootcamp). If you already know Android and like what we are doing, **please email us** at **help (at) codepath.com** and we'd love to talk with you!

Also, if you have any feedback or just want to chat with us, please reach out to **contact (at) codepath (dot) com**. In addition, we are a fledgling bootstrapped startup so if you like this guide and what we are trying to do, please consider [donating to the cause](https://gratipay.com/nesquena/)!
